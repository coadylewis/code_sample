These are the instructions for what you can put into a world using
	the text interface. 

Unknown tokens are ignored. Valid commands can start anywhere, not just
	at the beginnings of lines. After a known keyword, the correct 
	number of arguments MUST occur, separated by spaces. 
	Otherwise you get an unhandled exception. 

The keyword commands can come in any order and can be repeated. 

The recognized keywords (case is ignored) and the number of integer 
	arguments for each is as follows.

streets 1
	the parameter is the number of streets to draw (use about 10).
avenues 1
	the parameter is the number of avenues to draw (use about 10).
beepers 3
	e.g. beepers 3 4 1 means that at the corner of street 3 and 
	avenue 4 there is 1 beeper
eastwestwalls 3
	e.g. eastwestwalls 3 2 4 means that North of street 3 there 
	is a wall that crosses avenues 2 through 4
northsouthwalls 3
	e.g. northsouthwalls 1 4 4 means that East of Avenue 1 there 
	is a wall that crosses only street 4 (streets 4 through 4).
