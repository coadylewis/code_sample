ECEN 404-906
Team 61: Driver Drowsiness Detection System
Update 2/15/2022 for Max Lesser

--Ali Imran - ML Model--
Finished ML Model's Live Analysis functions:
  - saving/loading trained ML model and normalization parameters
  - trained model predicting label for new processed data


--Coady Lewis - Signal Processing--
Finished integrating ML code with live analysis
  - classifies data in real time from an updating file
  - logs information about outputs
  - saves raw data from run as a backup
  - tested with test script and with real muse stream
Partially automated parameter tuning for the SPML script
  - can test any number of specified (window, advancement) pairs
  - used to test 20 different combinations, as well as record their runtime
  


--Dakota Mouton - EEG Device--
Resolved bug with incoming signal from EEG circuit
  -The live signal from the electrodes to the arduino would only pick
  up a signal on first contact with the electrodes and then would zero out
  but after adding a third electrode to be the reference ground electrode and
  leaving the other two as the positive and negative input electrodes the signal
  is now continous and able to better processed.
Continuing progress on EEG/computer interface integration via arduino MCU
  -made great progress on python code that graphs both the live signal from the electrodes
  and displaying the FFT spectrum analyzer graph to show spikes at our target frequencies.
  -Although the live signal is now working the FFT graph is not updating from the input signal
  data yet so I will be troubleshooting this issue and get the FFT graph updating with the
  live signal so you can see both at the same time updating at the same time for accurate
  analysis of what the hardware is doing.
