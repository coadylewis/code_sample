ECEN 404-906
Team 61: Driver Drowsiness Detection System
Update 3/22/2022 for Max Lesser

---[Ali Imran/Coady Lewis]---
Progress: 
 - tested model with data from new subject (Dakota)
 - tested model with "grey area" data
 - light testing done over quick transition periods (awake->drowsy->awake)
 - data augmentation script completed

Plans:
 - extend current Neural Network with LSTM layer (create an RNN) to classify over sequenced data
 - collect more "grey area" data closer to the transition period
 - do a long session run/collect data multiple times over a single day (long sequence of awake->long sequence of drowsy)


---[Dakota Mouton - EEG Device]---
 - Finishing FFT Live Spectrum Analzyer for graphing peak target frequencies.
 - Start validations (hopefully) soon!
