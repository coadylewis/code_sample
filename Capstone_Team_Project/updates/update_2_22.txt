Update 2/22/2022 for Max Lesser

---[Ali Imran - ML Model]---
Progress: 
- completed live analysis graph showing model classification output in real-time
Plans:
- collect more "grey area" training data
- do more real-time testing (awake, in-between, drowsy)


---[Coady Lewis - Signal Processing]---
- tested of classification of unseen data with 1960 and 2240 windows on advancement=160
- trained with advancement=80
- tried training with one extra frequency band and modified limits
   -improvement was low (easily matched by more advancement) and time cost was high.
   -current band limits should be sufficient


---[Dakota Mouton - EEG Device]---
 - getting PCB ordered
 - working on live spectrum analyzer graph in software integration
